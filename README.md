# Physics-of-complex-systems-Python
Physics of complex systems - As a class participant, 
I share my solutions to the tasks created in the Physics of complex system course at one of Poland's technical universities. 
These are my solutions, but they are not my assignments! I did my best to create high quality code and also improve my style of coding. 

Written in Python.
