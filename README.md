# Physics-of-complex-systems-Python
Physics of complex systems - As a class participant, 
I share my solutions to the tasks created in the Physics of complex system course at one of Poland's technical universities. 
These are my solutions, but they are not my assignments! I did my best to create high quality code and also improve my style of coding. 

Written in Python.

Everything based on own experience and knowledge from university. 

Some functionalities are described in python files, so feel free to open them :)
